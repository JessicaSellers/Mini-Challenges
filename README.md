## Welcome to my first Github.io

I am going to go over 6 mini-challenges that I completed is iOs App Development 2

### Mini Challenge 1 - Functions

Requirements:
- Create a function, called check, that takes in an Int and returns an optional String.
- The input parameter should be called value.
- If the passed in argument is negative or zero, return nil.
- Else return a string version of the argument.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JessicaSellers/Mini-Challenges/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
